1. Use normal ssd and install windowsd on normal ssd.
2. Keep the ssd connected!
3. Try to install windows on NVME with UEFI enabled no legacy
4. windows will reboot unsuccessfully ( Remove the installation usb )
5. use the bios/windows recovery to boot in your NORMAL SSD
6. clean usb (the one you will keep in your pc to boot nvme)
7. convert gpt
8. create 100mb partition fat32 uefi assign a letter
9. use easyUEFI to backup UEFI from NORMAL SSD (Optional use BCDEDIT to set boot timeout to 0)
10. use easyUEFI to restore the backup to the usb UEFI partition (AFTER install of the windows on nvme with usb)
11. create  +- 300mb partition on usb with FAT or FAT32 format. make primary / active (the rest of the usb you can use as storage)
12. Use DEUT to format. the 300MB PARTITION (lETTER YOU can look up in Disk management)
13. Use DEUT to set boot on 300MB partition (can be skipped i think)
14. Uase DUET to install REFINED on the 300mb partition
15. now boot the new USB in the second UEFI option (the first will fail) set the bios to boot the second UEFI on your usb.
16. windows will continue the installation on NVME 
17. Edit your timeout in the config on the usb  to -1 . save. Your done! dont remove the usb if you want to boot the NVME

(some steps can be inccorect this gives a basic idea how to use it)
